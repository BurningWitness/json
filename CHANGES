Version 0.4.1: released 2009-01-12; changes from 0.3.6

  * Addition of extra JSON instances:
       - IntMap, Set, Array, IntSet
       
  * Dropped initial letter case-lowering for constructors: 
       - Maybe's constructors are mapped to "Nothing","Just".
       - Either's constructors are mapped to "Left", "Right".

  * Ordering's are represented by their constructor names (was
    funky int-mapping.)

  * JSON.Text.Result is now an instance of MonadError; contributed
    by Andy Gimblett.

  * Included Lennart Augustsson's contributed generic JSON encoder,
    in Text.JSON.Generic

  * Optional JSON dict-mapping for Data.Map and Data.IntMap
